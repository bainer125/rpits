RPITS Initial Setup Notes
-------------------------

* Be sure you have installed php5-imagick and restarted Apache.
* PHP short tags need to be enabled (this can be done in php.ini or by adding
  `php_flag short_open_tag on` to the Apache config.
* Web server needs to be able to write to the `cache`, `thumbs`, and `out`
  directories. 
  (e.g. `chgrp www-data cache thumbs out; chmod g+w cache thumbs out`).
* The database needs to be initialized with some seed data (TODO)
* Fonts need to be placed in the `fonts` directory. The fonts used in the
  default theme cannot be distributed with rpits, so they are not included.
* You will have issues if RAM is scarce. If running with limited RAM (e.g.
  on a VPS), make sure that some swap space is available.
